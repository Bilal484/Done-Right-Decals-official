                            We rely on cookies and other similar tracking technologies on your device to show interest-based advertisements. As a result, we also use cookies to store your "opt-out" preferences in your browser when you submit a request. If you use another device or browser when visiting the Done Right Decal Company website, or if you clear your cookies, you will need to resubmit your request.

                            You may also use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt out on your behalf if you provide the authorized agent signed written permission to do so. Authorized agents may submit requests to opt out by contacting our Customer Service team.

                            Interest-based advertisements use cookies or other similar tracking technologies on your device. By preventing your browser from accepting new third-party cookies, you can prevent the collection of Personal Information that is "sold" or "shared". The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to enable or prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

                            There are many features on the Done Right Decal Company website that rely on cookies and do not involve the sale or sharing of your Personal Information. For example, we use cookies to help keep you signed in to your account. If you choose to disable all cookies in your browser controls, you may also lose access to some of these features.

                        <p>
                            You may use an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”), to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information. Upon accessing the Done Right Decal Company website, we will process the GPC signal automatically as a valid request to opt out. If you do not have a Done Right Decal Company account, or if you are not logged into your Done Right Decal Company account, your request to opt out of the sale or sharing will only be linked to your browser identifier since the connection between your browser and your Done Right Decal Company account is not known to us. If you would like us to make the connection, you will need to log into your Done Right Decal Company account.
